Question 1 : What effect do comments have on a program?
Answer:
 Comments are for the programmer. When the compiler converts the source code to object code,
it throws the comments and the white space away. This means that they have no effect on the
executable program. Comments do make your source file bigger, but this is usually of little
concern. To summarize, you should use comments and white space to make your source code as
easy to understand and main-tain as possible.
Question 2 : What is the difference between a statement and a block?
Answer:
 A block is a group of statements enclosed in braces ({}). A block can be used in most places that
a statement can be used.
Question 3 : How can I find out what library functions are available?
Answer:
 Many compilers come with a manual dedicated specifically to documenting the library functions.
They are usually in alphabetical order. Another way to find out what library functions are available
is to buy a book that lists them. Appendix E, "Common C Functions," lists many of the available
functions. After you begin to understand more of C, it would be a good idea to read these
appendixes so that you don't rewrite a library function. (There's no use reinventing the wheel!)
