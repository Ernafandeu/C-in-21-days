Question:
 What effect do spaces and blank lines have on how a program runs?
Answer:
 White space (lines, spaces, tabs) makes the code listing more readable. When the program is compiled,
white space is stripped and thus has no effect on the executable program. For this reason, you should use
white space to make your program easier to read.
Question:
 Is it better to code a compound if statement or to nest multiple if statements?
Answer:
 You should make your code easy to understand. If you nest if statements, they are evaluated as shown
in this chapter. If you use a single compound statement, the expressions are evaluated only until the entire
statement evaluates to false.
Question:
 What is the difference between unary and binary operators?
Answer:
 As the names imply, unary operators work with one variable, and binary operators work with two.
Question:
 Is the subtraction operator (-) binary or unary?
Answer:
 It's both! The compiler is smart enough to know which one you're using. It knows which form to use
based on the number of variables in the expression that is used. In the following statement, it is unary:
x = -y;
versus the following binary use:
x = a - b;
Question:
 Are negative numbers considered true or false?
